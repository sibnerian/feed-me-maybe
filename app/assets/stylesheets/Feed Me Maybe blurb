Feed Me Maybe is an app for the poor, hungry college student who doesn't want to pay for food. Campus organizations put in the date and menu of their free food events, and users can find the soonest, closest food opportunities on the web or through the iOS app. A built-in RSVP system makes it easy for clubs to track how many attendees they should expect and helps them plan accordingly. Built using Ruby on Rails, iOS, SendGrid, and Google Maps.
